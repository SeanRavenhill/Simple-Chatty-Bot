### Project: Simple Chatty Bot

#### About
Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own. Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!

#### Learning outcomes
You’ll get to know the basic syntax of Python and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and functions.

#### *Personal Notes:
Just a fun and rather arbitrary project. Good working through it, as the content of the lessons helps in brushing up on some of the basics. I also learned some nuances to some of the core concepts of Python, which had not been covered in the other Python courses I have taken.

My approach to learning to code right now is using these basic projects to drill and practise my core and fundamental programming skills. I believe much like an athlete or any other skill-based endeavour. Going back and drilling and practising the basics regularly helps to compound towards a solid skillset and experience base for when dealing with complex problems and projects.
